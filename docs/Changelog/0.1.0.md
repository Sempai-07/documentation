# Telegramsjs@0.1.0

## Changes:

- Replaced parameters in functions where data needs to be specified, for example, in bot.sendMessage({ text: 'lala', button: [...] }), with replyMarkup, since replyMarkup is responsible not only for buttons.
- Changed parameters in `downloadFile` and `getFile` functions. Now they must be specified in an object.
- Fixed an error in the function name. The name `exportChatInviteLink` was changed to `portChatInviteLink`.
- All functions now return the contents of result instead of { ok: true, result: [...] }, which simplifies interaction with functions that output data.
- Now it is necessary to enter replyMarkup in the format JSON.stringify({ inline_keyboard: [[button.toJSON()]] }) instead of replyMarkup/button: [[button.toJSON()]] on all functions where it is required. This change was made for the sake of parameter unification.
- One of the main changes is that now the bot will not respond to outdated messages, even if it was turned off or stuck. Previously, this could lead to temporary bans.

## Added:

- Added the `getMe()` function, which returns information about the client (bot).

## Fixed:

- Fixed the `message.reply()` method.
- Fixed the `message.update()` method.

## In the next update:

- Parameters will be changed according to event names.
- New methods will be added for the message object for each event separately.
