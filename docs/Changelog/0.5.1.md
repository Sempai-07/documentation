# Telegramsjs@0.5.1

## Fixes

- Fixed issues with `once` and `on` functions, now they work reliably as the `BaseClient` class inherits from the `EventEmitter` class.

## Added

- Added the `ChatRight` constant, which provides all rights for the chat.
- Added an asynchronous method `ping()` for the `TelegramBot` class.

## Removed

- Removed the use of the `JSON.stringify` method from the `restrictChatMember` and `sendPoll` methods.

## Changes

- Expanded information in the `client` object.
