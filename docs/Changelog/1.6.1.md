# Telegramsjs@1.6.1

## Added
- Added the `channelType` parameter to the `command` method, which will respond to the specified chat type, defaulting to `false` (i.e., all chat types).
- Methods `getGameHighScores` and `setGameScore` are now also available in `BaseClient` and `Context`.

## Changed
- Now all static methods in `Markup` are also available as regular methods through `setText`.

## Fixed
- Fixed the `chat` method in `CombinedClass`, which could lead to an error when using context methods in `callback_query` events.
