# Telegramsjs@1.5.0

## Added
- Added the `action` method to track `callback_query` updates.
- Added the `hears` method, which will trigger if a specified word is present in the message.
- Introduced the `CombinedClass` class similar to `Context`.
- Added the `Context` type to describe methods in events.
- Added the `messageCollector` method in the event context and the `MessageCollector` class.

## Changed
- Replaced `https` with `axios`.
- Updated the typings to depend on `@telegram.ts/types` instead of using generic types like `any`, `object`, and `@ts-ignore`.
- Improved typing in all functions and classes.
- Merged the `Keyboard` and `Markup` classes into a single entity (`Markup`).
- The `processUpdate` method can now be used in webhooks and is available in the `TelegramBot` class.
- Added several methods to the event context, simplifying the use of `BaseClient` methods.

## Fixed
- Corrected regular expressions in the `checkUsername`, `checkBot`, and `checkPhoneNumber` functions.
- Fixed the `list` function in `markdownv` markup.
- Improved overall typing.
- Resolved a crash caused by passing non-class `IntentsBitField` parameter to the `decodeIntents` function.

- Eliminated most parameters in classes.
