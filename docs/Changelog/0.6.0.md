# Telegramsjs@0.6.0

## Fixed
- Fixed the use of an HTML tag in the `underline` function of the `Markdown` class.
- With the new `offset` mechanism, the bot will no longer read or respond to old messages or interactions (testing).

## Removed
- All events of type `privateMessageCreate` have been removed.

## Added
- Added events: `message`, `edited_message`, `channel_post`, `edited_channel_post`, `inline_query`, `chosen_inline_result`, `callback_query`, `shipping_query`, `pre_checkout_query`, `poll`, `poll_answer`, `chat_member`, `my_chat_member`, `chat_join_request`, `reply_message`. Previous events are unreliable.
- Added the `queryString` parameter to the `TelegramBot` class for setting the types of API request strings (optional).
- Added methods to the `Markup` (`Button`) class:
  - `inlineKeyboard(inline: array)`: returns an object representing an inline keyboard in the format expected by the Telegram Bot API.
  - `setRemove(remove: boolean)`: sets the `remove_keyboard` parameter to remove the keyboard after the user presses a button.
  - `addMarkupArray(markupArray: array, arrayLength: number)`: creates a JSON string representing a response markup object with an inline keyboard.
  - `setWebApp(url: string)`: sets the URL for the web application.
  - `setForceReply(forceReply: boolean)`: sets the `force_reply` option for the reply keyboard.
  - The constructor now has the parameters `removeKeyboard`, `forceReply`, and `webApp`.
- Added the `Keyboard` class for creating new keyboard objects.
- Added the constant `ChatActionType` containing all types for sending chat actions.
- Added the constant `EntityType` for different types of entities.
- Added the constant `QueryString` representing a set of request string types.
- Added the constant `GroupPermission` containing group permissions.
- Added the constant `DocumentTypes` containing document types.
- Added the constant `GroupStatus` representing the status of a group member.
- Added functions: `checkMessageLinks`, `extractUserMentions`, `extractHashtags`, `checkLocation`, `checkUserMentions`, `checkHashtags`, `checkPhoneNumber`, `extractUserIdFromLink`, `checkGroupOrChannel`, `checkEmoji`, `checkSticker`, `extractUsernameFromLink`, `checkBot`, `checkChannel`, `checkLink`, `checkGroup`, `checkUsername`, `extractUsername`.
- Added the `typing` method to the `chat` object.
- Added `.d.ts` files for all modules. Static analysis tools automatically use these declaration files to ensure proper typing and provide hints when working with the library (testing for now).
- Added methods to `Collection`: `keyAt`, `randomKey`, `reverse`, `sweep`, `partition`, `flatMap`, `mapValues`, `equals`, `concat`, `intersect`, `subtract`, `difference`.

## Changed
- Reduced the amount of information in the `client` object.
- Added the `offSetType` option, set to `default` by default. This option is intended for the new `offset` mechanism. If you specify other values, they will only be applied in classes inherited from `Map`. This is currently a testing feature, and in the future, you can use this feature or configure it yourself, similar to `telegraf.js` (upcoming updates).
- Renamed the `Button` class to `Markup`.
- Renamed the constant `ChatRight` to `ChatPermission`.
- Modified the `Events` constant to accommodate the new events.
- In `

TelegramApiError` errors, error messages now start with a lowercase letter. The error message format has also been changed.
- The `BaseClient` class can now be imported from the library itself, allowing you to create your own interesting library or implement your own event system, etc.
- The `Request` class can now be imported from the library itself, allowing you to use API requests independently and create your own applications.

## The Most Important and Exciting Part
- The `Collection` class is now a separate library "`@telegram.ts/collection`" by `telegramsjs`. However, you don't need to install it manually as it will still work in `telegramsjs`.
- The formatting functions are now a separate library "`@telegram.ts/formatters`" by `telegramsjs`. However, you don't need to install it manually as it will still work in `telegramsjs`.
