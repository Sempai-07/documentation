# Telegramsjs@1.7.1

## Fixes

- `setStickerEmoji` -> `setStickerEmojiList`
- `Context` parameters responsible for `id`, `message_id`, `callback_query_id`, and so on, were constantly being passed as `undefined`, leading to errors.

## Added

- In `hears`, you can now specify an array of words to track.
- `command` and `hears` now accept regular expressions (test feature).
- In the `end` and `interval` events of the `MessageCollector` class, a parameter has been added that returns the `MessageCollector` instance itself.

## Changed

- `with` and `keyAt` methods in the `Collection` class can now accept negative numbers.
- The error in `TelegramApiError` now shows the parameters of the function where the error occurred, but only if the `parameters` option was not received from Telegram.
- The `ok` parameter in `TelegramApiError` will now return only `boolean` values, not `undefined`.
- The `login` method will now entirely throw an exception if something goes wrong, and it becomes asynchronous.

## Updated

- The `ChatPermission` constant.
- The `GroupStatus` constant.
