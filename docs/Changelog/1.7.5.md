# Telegramsjs@1.7.5

## Changes

- The `command` function now reacts only when there is a `text` property in the object. Previously, an error occurred if there was a `caption`.
- The `hears` function now reacts to both `text` and `caption`. The `args` parameter is also applicable.
- The `args` parameter in `hears` is now strictly of type `string[]`.

## Additions

- In `hears`, a new parameter `caption` has been introduced to specify whether to track only `text` or both.

## Fixes

- In `command` and `hears`, the `args` parameter now ignores spaces, resulting in an array without them.

## Miscellaneous

- The `MessageCollector` class now accepts `Generic` and has improved class-level typing (the `filter` parameter).
- Some comments have been corrected for accuracy.
