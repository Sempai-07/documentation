# Telegramsjs@0.9.0

## Changes

- Fixed an issue where the `ready` event was being triggered even when an incorrect token was used.
- Replaced comments related to `buttons` and `button` types with `markups` and `markup` respectively.
- Made functions in the `BaseClient.d.ts` file asynchronous and replaced the return types (`object`, `boolean`) with `Promise<type>`.
- Changed the import of `Collection` and `Search` classes.
- If an unknown error occurs, the `TelegramApiError` class will throw an error with the message `unknown error` and code `0`.

## Added

- Added the following methods to the `Request` class `set..`:

  - `setToken(token)`: Sets the token for the bot. Takes a string `token` as an argument and returns `true` if the token was successfully set.
  - `setIntents(intents)`: Sets the intents for the bot. Takes `intents` as an argument in the format of a string, array, or number, and returns `true` if the intents were successfully set.
  - `setParseMode(parseMode)`: Sets the parse mode for formatting bot messages. Takes a string `parseMode` as an argument and returns `true` if the parse mode was successfully set.
  - `setChatId(chatId)`: Sets the chat ID for the bot. Takes a string or number `chatId` as an argument and returns the set `chatId`.
  - `setQueryString(queryString)`: Sets the query string for the bot. Takes a string `queryString` as an argument and returns `true` if the query string was successfully set.
  - `setOffsetType(offsetType)`: Sets the offset type for bot updates. Takes a string `offsetType` as an argument and returns the set offset type.
    Each of these methods is intended for setting the corresponding bot parameters and returns a value indicating the success of setting the parameter.

- Added the following methods to the `MessageCollector` class:
  - `count()`: Returns the number of collected messages.
  - `clear()`: Clears the collected messages.
  - `setFilter(filter)`: Sets a new filtering function for the collector.
  - `setTime(time)`: Sets a new duration for the collector.
  - `setMax(max)`: Sets a new maximum number of messages to collect.
  - `isRunning()`: Returns `true` if the collector is currently active, and `false` otherwise.
