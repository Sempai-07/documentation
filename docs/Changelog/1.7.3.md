# Telegramsjs@1.7.3

## Fixed
- `TelegramApiError` now returns a simple error message like `message text is empty` instead of `Bad Request: ...`. If there are more than two colons `:`, they will also be displayed, and only the initial part will be removed.

## Added
- `hears` now provides `args`, an array of strings, in the callback function, which the user entered.
- `action` now supports regular expressions.

## Other Changes
- `command`, `action`, and `hears` have been optimized.
- Comments in the `TelegramBot` class have been fixed.
- The entire code is now compiled for `es5`, instead of `es6` as before.
- The package will not be installable on versions of `nodejs` below `14.x.x`.
