# Telegramsjs@0.3.0

In the new update of Telegramsjs@0.3.0, new functions were added that can be useful for developers.

In particular, the following functions were added to the `html` and `markdownv` objects:

- `bold()` - a function that adds bold formatting to text.
- `italic()` - a function that adds italic formatting to text.
- `underline()` - a function that adds underline formatting to text.
- `strikethrough()` - a function that adds strikethrough formatting to text.
- `code()` - a function that adds code formatting to text.
- `link()` - a function that adds a link to text.
- `image()` - a function that adds an image to text.
- `paragraph()` - a function that adds a paragraph to text.
- `list()` - a function that adds a list to text.
- `codeBlock()` - a function that adds a code block to text.

In addition, the `heading()` function was added to the `markdownv` object, which adds a heading to text.

These functions can be useful for formatting text in chatbots and other applications that work with text. For example, they can be used to add emphasis, code formatting, links, and images to messages.

Thanks to these functions, developers can make messages in their chatbots more visually appealing and easier for users to understand.
