- Now the `Collection` class will not appear in the output of functions as `[Collection { item: {}...}, 15]`. Only specific values will be displayed where necessary, instead of the entire class.
- All classes and functions, except `session` (which will be further developed), `processUpdate`, and `request`, have completely removed the use of `any` ðŸ§¸.
- Methods like `checkMessageLinks` are now accessible in the `util` object within all events (except `update`).

## Fixed

### Collection
