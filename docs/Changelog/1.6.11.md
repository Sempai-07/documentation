# Telegramsjs@1.6.11
## Fixes:
- Fixed the `action` method where the `answer` parameter was causing an error when set to true and subsequently pressing the button.
- Updated the `version` constant.
- Fixed an issue that occurred when reconnecting to the internet or experiencing other failures related to reading the `data` property, which was previously undefined (`Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'data')`).
