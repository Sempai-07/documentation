# Telegramsjs@2.0.0

## Added
- Introduced the `unpinAllGeneralForumTopicMessages` method (API 6.8).
- Added the `inlineQuery` method, which registers a callback function to execute when an inline query matches the specified text.
- Added the `gameQuery` method, which registers a callback function when a message containing a "game" object is received.
- Introduced the `MenuBuilder` class for creating menus with buttons.
- Introduced the `Keyboard` class for creating menus from keyboards.
- Added parameters to the `TelegramBot(token, { limit, timeout, allowed_updates })` constructor.
- Added a `combine` parameter to the `TelegramBot.use` method, which merges the previous session with the new one (default is `false`).
- Added a `caption` parameter to the `TelegramBot.hears` method (whether to respond to captions, default is `false`).
- Added new tests.

## Removed
- Removed the `buildKeyboard` and `is2D` methods from the `Markup` class, as all methods are now public by default (in plain JavaScript).
- Removed the `public` keyword from all classes, as all methods are already public by default.
- Removed the `decodeIntents` function.
- Removed the `IntentsBitField` class.
- Removed the `leave` and `kickChatMember` methods in the context.

## Fixed
- The context was missing methods that should have been present since version `1.7.4` (`setMyDescription`, `getMyDescription`, `setMyShortDescription`, `setMyName`, `getMyName`).
- The `setWebhook` method was behaving like `getMe`.
- In `TelegramBot.command`, if you specified, for example, `test`, `test1`, `test2`, and then wrote `test`, all commands (`test1`, `test2`) would execute along with `test`.
- In `TelegramBot.action`, if you specified the `answer` parameter, it triggered for all interactions with `callback_query:data`.

## Changed
- `intents` is now `TelegramBot.options.allowed_updates`.
- The type of `session` changed from `any` to `unknown`.
- `session` now has default values (`{}`).
- `events` no longer need to be described as before. Events of the type `message:text` and `message:caption` have also been added.
- The `Request` class now accepts a generic type, which is done for events.
- The `on` method now allows specifying an array of events. Type errors are added if a non-array and non-string is specified.
- The `Collection.hasKeys` and `Collection.hasValues` methods now return `false` if emptiness is specified instead of an empty object.
- The `TelegramBot.command` method, specifically the `args` parameter, will always return an array of strings, not `undefined | string[]`.
- The `action`, `command`, and `hears` methods return `TelegramBot`.
- The `send` method in the context is no longer part of the `chat` object; it is now available as a method, for example, `reply`.
- The following methods now accept two parameters: `deleteWebhook`, `sendMessage`, `banChatSenderChat`, `unbanChatSenderChat`, `revokeChatInviteLink`, `approveChatJoinRequest`, `declineChatJoinRequest`, `setChatPhoto`, `deleteChatPhoto`, `setChatTitle`, `setChatDescription`, `unpinChatMessage`, `deleteMessage`, `answerWebAppQuery`, `setPassportDataErrors`, `setStickerSetTitle`, `setCustomEmojiStickerSetThumbnail`, `unpinAllChatMessages`, `getChatMember`, `setChatStickerSet`, `closeForumTopic`, `reopenForumTopic`, `deleteForumTopic`, `unpinAllForumTopicMessages`, `editGeneralForumTopic`, `deleteMyCommands`, `getMyCommands`, `setMyName`, `setMyDescription`, `setMyShortDescription`, `setChatMenuButton`, `setMyDefaultAdministratorRight`, `setStickerPositionInSet`, `setStickerEmojiList`, `setStickerKeywords`, `setStickerMaskPosition`.

## Miscellaneous
- Improved code readability, added comments for all classes and methods.
- Renamed variables to more logical names.
- Renamed files and classes to more logical names.
