# Telegramsjs@1.6.5

## Added
- Now you can install `telegramsjs` using `Yarn`.

## Fixed
### Context
- When calling context methods for the `callback_query` event, the message identifier (`message_id`) was not being passed.

## Changed
### Markup
- The `generateReplyMarkup` method now returns a complete object with an array instead of the string that the `getReplyMarkup` method used to return.
- Improved typing in `Markup`, now using more accurate and useful types for parameters (previously, some functions lacked parameters, and there were many `any` types, but now they are no longer present).

## Removed
### Markup
- The `getReplyMarkup` method has been removed since the latest updates no longer require a string in `reply_markup` and related fields.
- All statistical methods in `Markup`, which were mistakenly added in the previous update, have been removed.
- Removed the `botRequest` method, replaced with a parameter in `userRequest`.
- Removed the `channelRequest` and `groupRequest` methods, now replaced by `chatRequest`.
